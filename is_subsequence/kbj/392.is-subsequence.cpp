 * Testcase Example:  '"abc"\n"ahbgdc"'
 *
 * 
 * Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and
 * t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short
 * string (
 * 
 * 
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original
 * string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing
 * the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a
 * subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
 * 
 * 
 * Return true.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
 * 
 * 
 * Return false.
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you
 * want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario,
 * how would you change your code?
 *
